# video colour summary

## Summarise a video into a single image

Tested with
- `Windows 10`
- `Python 3.6.0`
- `Numpy 1.13.1`
- `OpenCV 3.3.0`

### Getting Started
1. Place your video file in the `video` folder
2. In `main.py`, change the value of the `file_name` variable, including your file's extension
3. Run `main.py`, and wait - it isn't very fast!
4. Once complete, the script will save your image into the `output` folder, and show you a preview of it
5. Press any key to close the preview window, and exit the script
